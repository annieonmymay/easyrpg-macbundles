Yume Nikki 0.10
---

Yume Nikki (ゆめにっき - "Dream Diary") is an experimental game by
Japanese indie developer Kikiyama where you explore the dreams
of a young Hikkikomori girl called Madotsuki. It's mostly known
for its original (and sometimes disturbing) design, and also for
certain events and characters. Only in some few years it has
gained an enormous number of fans worldwide, even if it's actually
not finished (version 0.10 as of now).

This is a bloatless (with unrelevant files removed) english release
by Zanaveth 'UBX Master' The Corruptor. I think I managed to reduce
the size in about 40MB, and unlike Rozencrab (who did a great job
actually) I think I have kept ALL relevant files.

Also, I 'recovered' some missing files, like the 'FCM２ALL' one.
(Apparently, the problem was the original file had a '2' instead of '２')

Release 2 has more missing files added. And due to various big music files
being now compressed in mp3 (as in original Japanese release), the size of
the archive is reduced even more.

This, now, is Release 8 (I think). It should be the last ever I do. I have
removed the included applocale and other stuff just to make things simpler
for me, but not for you (unless you're actually not a lazy ass).

Well, here are some basic instructions...

Keys:

Arrow keys: movement
Z: interact, confirm
X: menu, cancel
1: use effect
3: cancel effect
5: drop effect (when in Nexus)
9: wake up
F4: toggle fullscreen
F5: toggle between 2x and 1x display size
F12: restart game (instantly go back to menu)

Important note before playing:

Yume Nikki requires you to have your OS's locale set to Japanese. The proccess can be
really different depending on the OS, a quick google search may help. Alternatively, you
can just use AppLocale.

You no longer require the runtime package for Rpgmaker2003, unlike for the other releases.

How to play:

-Go to sleep in your bed and open the door to enter the dream world.
-Explore the dream world and collect the various 'effects' scattered around it (some of them can be helpful)
-Be aware the dream world is very large, so you might get lost. It is recommended that you use landmarks (Structures or patterns that can be easily recognized, for example) for easier navigation.
-If you really get lost or get stuck somewhere, press 9 to wake up.
-You can save the game at your desk when you're awake.

Troubleshooting:

-Crash with "<file> not found" or similar messages:
 -I might have accidentally removed that file during the unbloating proccess, please contact me if this happens.
-Crash with "not implemented" message:
 -That's not my fault, you should contact Kikiyama in this case.

Editing YN with Rpgmaker2003:

-Run Rpgmaker2003 (with locale set to Japanese).
-Go to "Open Project" and set project path to the folder where you extracted the game folder (not the game folder itself).
-You should see the YN directory under the game list now, select it and click on Open.
-??????
-Profit!

Other things:

Special thanks to Kikiyama for the game, obviously.
and also to the Uboachan community (which is now full of cancer... I really miss the old days).
And of course to whoever translated the game to English (I don't know who it was...).
